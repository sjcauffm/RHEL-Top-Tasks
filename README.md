# RHEL-Top-Tasks
Cleaning and Plotting data from RHEL Top Tasks

The scripts here are for cleaning data from a qualtrics survey modeled after Gerry McGovern's top tasks analysis method. 
The cleaned data were then used to generate a graph that shows statistically, which tasks are more important others. 

There were two surveys so far posted here and the structures of each were different so it required two different scripts and then a third script to combine the data before plotting.
